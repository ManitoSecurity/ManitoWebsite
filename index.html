                <p>
                    Gone are the days of monthly fees, ongoing charges, and costly set up charges. Manito Security is a
                    low, one time purchase with a lifetime of free firmware upgrades.

                <h3>OPEN SOURCE</h3>
                <p>
                    Manito Security is made up of a team of tinkerers. We share that itch with thousands of other
                    developers to peer inside. Because of this itch, very early on, we decided that our security system
                    would be developer friendly.

                <p>
                    Just because Manito Security is open source doesn’t mean you need an engineering degree from MIT to
                    operate our security system. We have made spent many hours to make set up is a breeze and basic
                    customization painless.
